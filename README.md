# JavaFX Board Game Application

This is an Apache Maven 3 project that I made as an Assignment for my SWE class.

# Rules

- In each turn both players can move one of their pieces. 
- The Red player starts the game. 
- You can move to every direction, until an other place blocks the way.
- There are several win conditions in this game:
    - You win by having all your pieces in the same row or column.
    - You win by forming a 2 by 2 square shape with your pieces.
    - You win by having all your pieces in different corners.
    - You win if the other player corners one of your pieces.
